In this tutorial we describe a full Bayesian framework for species tree estimation. The statistical method- ology described in this tutorial is known by the acronym *BEAST (pronounced “star beast”).

This tutorial was for the [Taming the BEAST] (https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/taming-the-beast.html) workshop, 
modified from the [original] (https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/blob/master/doc/tutorials/STARBEAST/StarBEAST_tutorialv2.2.0.pdf) one 
written by Joseph Heled, Remco Bouckaert, Walter Xie and Alexei J Drummond.
